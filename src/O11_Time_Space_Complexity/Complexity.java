package O11_Time_Space_Complexity;
//Time complexity - Not the actual time taken but amount of time taking as function of input size(n).
/* - it is simple equation showing the number of operation increasing with the number of input.
 - complexity is always used in worst case scenario.
 - 1- Big O notation [O(n)] - It is upper bound and this is used in worst case.
  2 - Q theta notation   - it is average bound
  3 - O mega notation [  - it is lower bound used in best case
Common time complexity ;-
1 - O(1) Constant complexity -
2 - O(n) Linear complexity - simply state that n time number of operation will perform
3 - O(n^2)&O(n^3)   - mainly used in sorting
4- O(log n) - used in binary searching
5-  O(nlog n )  - it is used in sorting - merge, quick,
6- O(2^n) Exponential complexity - it comes in recursion
7- O(n!) - it is no so common , this is more worst case complexity


        Time complexity  = total no. of calls * work done in each call.


Space Complexity  - Amount of space taken by an algorithm as function of input size (n).
